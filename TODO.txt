- refactor Index.scala to update himself Rules and Facories instead of publid rulesButtonId factoryButtonId
- put all the model stuff in a single file (getProjects, getRules save etc.)
- highlight current project / Rules (or Factories) button / Rule (or Factory)
- review EditRules: test if jsonToRule has problems with \n, otherwise remove unnecessary code (see below)
- extract useful commented code for the future
