- highlight current project / Rules (or Factories) button / Rule (or Factory)
- review EditRules: test if jsonToRule has problems with \n, otherwise remove unnecessary code (see below)
- extract useful commented code for the future
- refactor names with meanings, I think:
  - Index.scala is a view (probably the only view) : MainView ?
  - EditRules.scala is a controller: RulesController?
  - make the model (getProjects, getRules, save etc.): MainModel?
