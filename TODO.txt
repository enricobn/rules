- highlight current project / Rules (or Factories) button / Rule (or Factory)
- extract useful commented code for the future
- refactor names with meanings, I think:
  - Index.scala EditRules.scala, ProjectsList.scala and Projectmenu.scala are views?
  - put business logic in RulesDAO (rename it to RulesModel?)
  - make a state object?
- now beans (XMLProject, XMlRule etc.) are not only beans, they contains logic (toXMl, save etc.), must I separate them?
- check for duplicated project's, module's, rule's and factory's names on add, and valid as ids (exept Rule)
- check for names of project and module: they cannot "move" from the appropriate folder (root for project,
  root/project.name for module)
